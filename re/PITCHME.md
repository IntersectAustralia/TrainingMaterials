### Find and Replace

- Most people will be aware of the *find* and *replace* options of programs such as *Word*.

- Often we use *find* to locate the occurrence of a particular word, phrase or number.

- E.g., _realize_, _cookie_, _the nothing itself noths_, _3.1415927_ |

+++

#### Sometimes the objective is…

- to find out *how many* matches there are
- to *locate* each match and *review* it in context |
- to *replace* or *substitute* that match for something else |
   - E.g.:
   - 101 occurrences of _realize_ |
   - replace _cookie_ with _biscuit_ |
   - replace _3.1415927_ with _π_ |
