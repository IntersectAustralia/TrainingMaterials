### Find and Replace

- Most people will be aware of the *find* and *replace* options of programs such as *Word*.
- Often we use *find* to locate the occurrence of a particular word, phrase or number.
  - realize
  - cookie |
  - 3.1415927 |

#### Sometimes the objective is…

- to find out how many matches there are
- to locate each match and review it in context |
- to replace or substitute that match for something else |
   - 101 occurrences of realize|
   - replace cookie with biscuit |
