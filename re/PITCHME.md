### Find and Replace

- Most people will be aware of the *find* and *replace* options of programs such as *Word*.
- Often we use find to locate the occurrence of a particular word, phrase or number.|
  - realize|
  - cookie |
  - 3.1415927 |

+++

#### Sometimes the objective is…

- to find out how many matches there are
   - _101 occurrences of "realize"_ |
- to locate each match and review it in context |
   - _"Cookie" occurs before "monster"_ |
- to replace or substitute that match for something else |
   - _"replace 3.1415927 with π"_ |
