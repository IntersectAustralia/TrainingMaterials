### Research Technology Impact

![research_technology_impact](assets/research_technology_impact.png)

Note:
Intersect is an eResearch company. eResearch is the delivery of specialist IT to researchers to enable them to do better and more efficient research, sometimes research that couldn’t otherwise be done.  Everything we do is about research. Every dollar we attract from government, members or corporations must obey our “three laws of eResearch”:
1. Increase research productivity by decreasing time from hypothesis to tested results. 
1. Support research diversity by enabling collaborators to share data and experience cross-discipline and cross-organisation. 
1. Increase research longevity by storing and sharing the long tail of data beyond the research project lifecycle.
